# SleepHours-Project6
Javascript Course Project Done For Calculate Sleep Hours


In this Javascript project for Javascript course I'm doing on Codecadmey Pro, I calculate if I'm getting enough sleep each week using a sleep debt calculator. This program will determine the actual and ideal hours of sleep each night of the last week. Lastly, it'll calculate in hours, how far I'm from my weekly sleep goal.
